# Scheduling Jobs on Identical Machines
Implementing Scheduling Jobs on Identical Machines using: 1.Greedy Algorithm and 2.Dynamic Programming

## Input:

Enter the number of machines in the first input line  
Enter the number of Jobs in the second input line  
The program generates n random jobs between [1,50] and implements both algorithms and finds the result for each algorithm  

<br />
*In PrjAlgoGraphicVersion.py file it also draw sample machines and jobs and their distribution using pygame for Dynamic Programmin Algorithm*
