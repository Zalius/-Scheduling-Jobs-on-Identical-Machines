# -Scheduling Jobs on Identical Machines
Implementing Scheduling Jobs on Identical Machines using: 1.Greedy Algorithm and 2.Dynamic Programming

##Input:
  Enter the number of machines in the first input line
  Enter the number of Jobs in the second input line
the program generates n random jobs between [1,50] and implements both algorithms and finds the result for each algorithm
